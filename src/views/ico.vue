          <b>What is a ICO (Initial coin offering)</b>
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3">
          An initial coin offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry's
          equivalent to an initial public offering (IPO). A company seeking to
          raise money to create a new coin, app, or service can launch an ICO as
          a way to raise funds. Interested investors can buy into an initial
          coin offering to receive a new cryptocurrency token issued by the
          company. This token may have some utility related to the product or
          service that the company is offering, or it may just represent a stake
          in the company or project.
